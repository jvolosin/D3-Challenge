            <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smokers and Income</h2>
            <p>The scatter plot shows there is a correlation between a person's income and if they are more likely to smoke or not. 
              State's with a higher income tend to have a lower percentage of smokers. Opposite, state's with lower income tend to have a higher percentage of smokers.</p>

            <p>Possible reasons for this could be that blue collar jobs, on average, pay less than white collar jobs. Blue collar jobs take place outside more than white collar jobs.
              Think of a typical construction site with workers standing around smoking. Of course we can't assume this holds true for every state. 
            </p>

            <p>Two outliers that stand out to me are Idaho and Alaska. Alaskan income is higher than most states' but almost 20% of the populations smokes. 
              I guess there is not much else to do out there but smoke and hunt? Meanwhile, Idaho income is on the lower side at just under $48,000 but only 15.9% of the population smokes.
              I wonder why that is?
